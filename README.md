Generalized Qualitative State Estimation (QSE)

This Script is based on the QSE algorithme, which Kris Villez implemented in Matlab. It produces a qualitative probabilistic estimation of a singal, which tells with which probabilty it follows a certain shape (e.g. goes down, up, stay constant, etc).  This method, based on the earlier developed Qualtiative Path estimation is further generalized by allowing all 39 different combinations of signs between
signal, first and second derivative and implements the possibility to choose from different kernels. Furthermore it is capable of handling different polynom order bigger than 1. This version is three times faster than the matlab version, because it's not using a loop over each moving window, but applying matrix calculations of all moving windows at same time. A estimation of the best bandwidth is uncluded by using generalized cross validation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- qse_algorithme.py: holds the main class generalQSE with its main methods run and plot.
- evaluation_script.py: evaluate a qualitative trend of the prediction data and ground_truth data and compares performance (classification accuracy and cross entropy) of different general QSE scenarios.
- diff_metric.py: auxilary file, which holds some difference metrics for comparing two qualitative trends.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6  (If not installed, go to  https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/,download Python 3.6.7 (64 bit) version and run installer)
- Git (If git is not installed, install it from https://git-scm.com/download/win, leave all install options to default)
- Pipenv (if not installed go to the Script directory, where your installed python is located (in my case C:\APPS\Python\Python36\Scripts), execute in cmd: pip install pipenv

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

    1.	Clone Code from Github (you can delete the other code we cloned)
        a.	In the cmd go to the directory you want the code to be cloned in.
        b.	In cmd: git clone https://github.com/kramersi/general-qse.git 
    2.	Create virtualenv for that project with pipenv
        a.	In cmd: cd general-qse  (to go into code directory)
        b.	In cmd: pipenv install (creating virtualenv for that project folder)
    3. Run script qse_algorithme in a console or common IDE like pyCharm
